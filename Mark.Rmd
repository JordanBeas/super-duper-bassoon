## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Hey!

comments do not need ### outside the code box

to write code you have to include it in a code box

```{r}
x <- rnorm (100, 0, 1)
y <- rnorm (100, 2, 3)
plot(x~y)

```

and then you knit to create the report!

```{r, echo = FALSE}



```

###Useful additions

echo = false to hide the code
eval = false not run the code when creating the report
fig.cap = "name" to add captions under my figures

![] for adding images! [name] (file name or link)

you can even add gifs in the report
